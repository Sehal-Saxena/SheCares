## 🌷 Introduction  
Women’s health and hygiene often remain under-discussed, with millions lacking access to awareness, preventive tools, or personalized care. Menstrual health, nutrition tracking, and self-examinations are essential parts of women’s well-being — yet these are often managed in isolation, or not at all.  

**SheCares** bridges this gap — a unified digital platform dedicated to empowering women to take control of their health through smart tracking, personalized recommendations, and AI-driven guidance.

## 💡 Problem Statement  
Despite advancements in health technology, several key issues persist:  
- Inconsistent menstrual tracking and unrecognized irregularities.  
- Lack of awareness around hygiene and preventive breast health.  
- Absence of an integrated platform combining menstrual, nutritional, and emotional wellness.  
- Limited access to personalized, empathetic health guidance.  

These challenges delay early detection of conditions like PCOS/PCOD, cause misinformation, and create emotional distress that can easily be avoided with intelligent digital support.
